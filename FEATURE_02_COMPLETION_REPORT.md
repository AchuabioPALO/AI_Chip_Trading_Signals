## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

### **Q: What exactly are "AI chip trading signals"? What do they tell me?**
**A:** These are specific BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations for AI semiconductor stocks (NVDA, AMD, TSM, INTC, QCOM). Think of it like a smart assistant that watches the bond market stress from Feature 01 and tells you: "Based on bond market patterns, NVDA is likely to go up/down in the next 20-40 days, so you should BUY with 2% of your portfolio." Each signal includes confidence level (1-10), entry price, and position size.

### **Q: How does this make money? What's the trading strategy?**
**A:** The core insight is **cross-asset correlation**:
1. **Bond markets stress first** (institutions get nervous)
2. **They sell tech stocks** (including AI chips) to buy "safe" bonds
3. **We detect this pattern early** using Feature 01's bond monitoring
4. **We predict the reversal** when bond stress peaks and money flows back to tech
5. **We generate signals** to buy AI chips during the dip or sell before the crash

### **Q: What's the difference between NOW/SOON/WATCH signals?**
**A:** These indicate urgency and timing:
- **NOW** (Red 🚨): High confidence, act immediately (>7.5 confidence score)
- **SOON** (Orange ⚠️): Medium confidence, prepare to act (5-7.5 confidence)
- **WATCH** (Green 👀): Early warning, monitor closely (3-5 confidence)
- **NEUTRAL** (Gray 😐): No clear signal, hold current positions

### **Q: How accurate is the machine learning? Can I trust these predictions?**
**A:** Our ML model is conservative and validated:
- **Training data:** 2020-2024 historical bond/stock correlation patterns
- **Walk-forward testing:** Prevents overfitting by testing on unseen future data
- **Confidence scoring:** Only high-confidence signals (>7.0) trigger real alerts
- **Risk management:** Position sizing limits losses even when wrong
- **Correlation monitoring:** System warns when historical patterns break down

### **Q: What's the risk management? How much money could I lose?**
**A:** Multiple safety layers built in:
- **Position limits:** Maximum 3% per stock, 20% total AI chip exposure
- **VIX-based sizing:** Lower positions during high volatility (VIX >30 = 0.5% max)
- **Stop-loss integration:** Every signal includes recommended exit price
- **Kelly Criterion:** Mathematical position sizing based on win rate and average returns
- **Correlation warnings:** Alerts if bond-chip relationships change

### **Q: How often do signals get generated? Am I going to be overwhelmed?**
**A:** Designed to be manageable:
- **5-10 signals per week** during normal market conditions
- **Rate limiting:** Maximum 3 signals per notification to prevent spam
- **High-confidence filtering:** Only actionable signals reach you
- **Daily summaries:** End-of-day reports instead of constant alerts
- **20-60 day horizons:** Not day-trading, these are swing trade signals

### **Q: What AI chip stocks does this cover? Can we add more?**
**A:** Currently covers the major AI semiconductor players:
- **NVDA** (NVIDIA) - GPU leader
- **AMD** (Advanced Micro Devices) - CPU/GPU competitor  
- **TSM** (Taiwan Semiconductor) - Chip manufacturer
- **INTC** (Intel) - Traditional CPU leader
- **QCOM** (Qualcomm) - Mobile/AI chips
**Adding more:** System is designed to easily add new symbols by updating the ticker list.

### **Q: How do I know if the system is making good predictions?**
**A:** Built-in performance tracking:
- **Signal performance database:** Tracks every prediction vs actual outcome
- **Win rate monitoring:** Percentage of profitable signals
- **Sharpe ratio calculation:** Risk-adjusted returns measurement
- **Drawdown tracking:** Maximum portfolio decline monitoring
- **Backtesting reports:** Historical "what if" analysis available via API

### **Q: What happens during market crashes or unusual events?**
**A:** System includes regime detection and adaptability:
- **VIX monitoring:** Automatically reduces position sizes during high volatility
- **Correlation breakdown alerts:** Warns when historical patterns stop working
- **Anomaly detection:** ML model identifies unusual market conditions
- **Emergency stops:** Can disable trading signals during extreme events
- **Manual override:** All signals can be paused via configuration

### **Q: How is this different from just buying and holding NVDA?**
**A:** Several key advantages:
- **Timing:** Enter/exit at better prices using bond market early warnings
- **Diversification:** Spread risk across multiple AI chip stocks
- **Risk management:** Position sizing prevents large losses
- **Correlation insights:** Understand when AI chips move together vs independently
- **Professional tools:** Same techniques used by quantitative hedge funds

### **Q: Can I backtest this strategy? How do I validate it works?**
**A:** Comprehensive backtesting available:
- **API endpoint:** `/api/run-backtest` for historical analysis
- **Custom date ranges:** Test any period from 2020-2024
- **Performance metrics:** Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, total return
- **Comparison benchmarks:** Results vs buying and holding
- **Walk-forward validation:** Tests on truly unseen future data

### **Q: What's the next step? How does this connect to the dashboard?**
**A:** This integrates with Feature 03 (Dashboard):
- **Real-time display:** All signals show up in the Next.js dashboard
- **Interactive charts:** Visualize bond stress vs chip stock movements
- **Performance tracking:** See your signal history and P&L
- **Manual controls:** Enable/disable signals, adjust position sizes
- **Mobile access:** Trade signals available on phone/tablet
