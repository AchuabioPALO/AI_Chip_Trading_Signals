## Project Context
This project is an AI Chip Trading Signal system that uses short-term bond market stress indicators to generate actionable 5-60 day trading signals for AI semiconductor stocks. Built with Python, machine learning libraries, and high-frequency financial APIs to create real-time trading alerts based on bond market stress spikes and momentum shifts.
- multi-asset correlation trading like two sigma
- mimicing real quant funds
- The system monitors bond market stress indicators (yield curve, MOVE index, credit spreads) to generate AI chip trading signals.
## Coding Style
- Use camelCase for variable names in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use snake_case for Python variables and functionsntern:
- Prefer arrow functions over traditional function expressions (JS/TS)
- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces
- concise language
- keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
-keep directories organized and no duplicate files
- make sure all problems are solved in the workspace before starting new tasks


## Testing
- Use pytest for Python unit testing
- Use Jest for any JavaScript/TypeScript components
- Use mocking for external API calls in tests

## Error Handling
- Always use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Use try/except blocks for Python error handling
- Log errors with contextual information
- Implement graceful degradation for API failures

## Bond Market Analysis Specifics
- Use high-frequency financial APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, FRED) for daily/intraday data
- Implement rolling z-scores on yield curve (10Y-2Y) over 20/60 day lookbacks
- Track MOVE index percentiles and credit spread momentum with 30-minute updates
- Use pandas for rolling window calculations and real-time signal processing
- Implement machine learning models (scikit-learn, isolation forests) for anomaly detection
- Create real-time visualizations with Next.js and Chart.js for trading signals and alerts
- Set up automated daily signal generation with Slack/Telegram notifications
- Ensure API rate limiting and error handling for high-frequency updates
- Implement backtesting framework for 20-60 day trading performance validation

## Trading Signal Features
- Use pandas and numpy for rolling z-score calculations and momentum indicators
- Implement threshold breach detection with time-to-trade flags (NOW, SOON, WATCH)
- Use time series analysis for 5-60 day signal generation and calibration
- Create instant alerting system via Slack/Telegram for actionable trade signals
- Store high-frequency data for short-term backtesting (30-90 day windows)
- Implement real-time signal scoring and position sizing recommendations
- Focus on actionable trading horizons with daily signal updates and P&L tracking
