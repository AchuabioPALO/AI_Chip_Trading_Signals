## 🏗️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Core Files Created:
- `backend/src/data_sources/fred_client.py` - FRED API client with timezone handling
- `backend/src/data_sources/yahoo_client.py` - Yahoo Finance client with rate limiting
- `backend/src/signals/bond_stress_analyzer.py` - Core bond stress calculations

- `backend/src/utils/database.py` - SQLite database manager with absolute paths
- `backend/src/utils/alert_system.py` - Multi-channel notification system
- `bond_stress_scheduler.py` - Autonomous 30-minute data collection

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Bond stress signals table
bond_stress_signals (
    id, timestamp, yield_curve_spread, yield_curve_zscore,
    bond_volatility, credit_spreads, signal_strength,
    confidence_score, suggested_action, created_at
)

-- Market data cache for API optimization
market_data_cache (
    id, data_type, symbol, timestamp, data_json, created_at
)

-- Performance tracking for signal validation
signal_performance (
    id, signal_id, symbol, entry_date, exit_date,
    entry_price, exit_price, return_pct, holding_days,
    signal_type, created_at
)
```

### Key Algorithms Implemented:

#### **1. Yield Curve Stress Detection**
```python
# Rolling z-score calculation for regime normalization
def calculate_rolling_zscore(data: pd.Series, window: int = 20) -> pd.Series:
    rolling_mean = data.rolling(window=window).mean()
    rolling_std = data.rolling(window=window).std()
    zscore = (data - rolling_mean) / rolling_std
    return zscore.fillna(0)

# 10Y-2Y spread with inversion detection
spread = ten_year_yields - two_year_yields
spread_zscore = calculate_rolling_zscore(spread, 20)
```

#### **2. Bond Volatility Monitoring**
```python
# TLT ETF volatility as bond stress proxy
def calculate_bond_volatility(bond_prices: Dict, window: int = 20) -> pd.Series:
    tlt_prices = bond_prices['TLT']['Close']
    returns = tlt_prices.pct_change().dropna()
    volatility = returns.rolling(window=window).std() * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized
    return volatility
```

#### **3. Credit Spread Analysis**
```python
# HYG/LQD spread as credit stress indicator
def calculate_credit_spreads(bond_data: Dict) -> pd.Series:
    hyg_returns = bond_data['HYG']['Close'].pct_change()
    lqd_returns = bond_data['LQD']['Close'].pct_change()
    credit_spread = lqd_returns - hyg_returns  # IG outperformance
    return credit_spread
```

#### **4. Signal Classification Logic**
```python
# Multi-factor stress signal generation
def _classify_stress_signal(self, spread_zscore_short, spread_zscore_long, 
                           volatility_zscore, credit_zscore) -> Tuple[SignalStrength, float, str]:
    stress_score = 0
    
    # Yield curve inversion (negative z-score = stress)
    if spread_zscore_short < -2.0:
        stress_score += 3  # Strong inversion signal
    elif spread_zscore_short < -1.5:
        stress_score += 2  # Moderate flattening
    
    # Volatility spike detection
    if volatility_zscore > 2.0:
        stress_score += 3  # High volatility
    elif volatility_zscore > 1.5:
        stress_score += 2  # Elevated volatility
    
    # Credit spread widening
    if credit_zscore > 2.0:
        stress_score += 3  # Significant credit stress
    
    # Signal strength determination
    if stress_score >= 7:
        return SignalStrength.NOW, min(10.0, stress_score + 1), "TRADE NOW"
    elif stress_score >= 4:
        return SignalStrength.SOON, min(8.0, stress_score), "PREPARE TO TRADE"
    elif stress_score >= 2:
        return SignalStrength.WATCH, min(6.0, stress_score), "MONITOR CLOSELY"
    else:
        return SignalStrength.NEUTRAL, max(1.0, stress_score), "No stress detected"
```
