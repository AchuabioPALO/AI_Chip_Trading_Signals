# Feature 09: Data Pipeline Health Monitoring
**Story Reference:** 09-monitor-data-pipeline-health.md

## Task Breakdown

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] **Real-Time Dashboard** - Prometheus/Grafana setup for pipeline health metrics
- [ ] **API Health Checks** - Monitor Fed APIs, Yahoo Finance, backup sources
- [ ] **Latency Monitoring** - Track data ingestion delays and processing times
- [ ] **Error Rate Tracking** - Monitor API failures, timeout rates, data corruption

### Data Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Freshness Validation** - Automated checks for data timestamps and staleness
- [ ] **Cross-Source Validation** - Compare data across multiple sources for consistency
- [ ] **Outlier Detection** - Statistical anomaly detection for suspicious data points
- [ ] **Schema Validation** - Ensure data format consistency and completeness

### Automated Failover System
- [ ] **Primary/Backup Switching** - Automatic failover when primary sources fail
- [ ] **Rate Limit Management** - Monitor and respond to API rate limit breaches
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - Prevent cascade failures when sources are unstable
- [ ] **Recovery Automation** - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

### Storage Optimization
- [ ] **Data Retention Policies** - Automated archival of old data to reduce costs
- [ ] **Compression Strategies** - Time-series data compression for storage efficiency
- [ ] **Database Performance** - Query optimization and index management
- [ ] **Backup and Recovery** - Automated backups with disaster recovery procedures

### Alert and Notification System
- [ ] **PagerDuty Integration** - Critical alerts for immediate engineer response
- [ ] **Slack Notifications** - Non-critical alerts for team awareness
- [ ] **Email Digests** - Daily/weekly pipeline health summaries
- [ ] **Escalation Matrix** - Alert routing based on severity and time of day

## Technical Dependencies
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
- Redis for caching and queues
- PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB optimization
- PagerDuty/Slack APIs

## Success Criteria
- 99.9% pipeline uptime during market hours
- <30s detection time for issues
- 99.5% data accuracy across sources
- Zero stale data in trading signals
- <$500/month storage costs
