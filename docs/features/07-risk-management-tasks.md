## Task Breakdown

### Position Sizing Algorithms

- [ ] **Signal Strength Integration** - Position size scales with signal confidence (1-10)
- [ ] **Portfolio-Level Constraints** - Max 3% individual position, 10% total drawdown limits
- [ ] **Kelly Criterion Implementation** - Optimal position sizing based on win rate and payoff

### Risk Monitoring System
- [ ] **Real-Time VIX Tracking** - Continuous volatility monitoring for position adjustments
- [ ] **Correlation Quality Alerts** - Automatic warnings when 60-day correlation <0.3
- [ ] **Concentration Risk** - Monitor sector/stock concentration limits
- [ ] **Drawdown Tracking** - Real-time portfolio and individual position drawdown monitoring

### Automated Risk Controls
- [ ] **Stop-Loss Generation** - Automatic stop orders based on historical drawdown patterns
- [ ] **Position Recalibration** - Dynamic position size adjustments as volatility changes
