## Story: Real-Time Data Pipeline Monitoring and Quality Assurance

**As a** data engineer,
**I want** real-time monitoring of data pipeline health with automated quality checks,
**so that** I can ensure signal accuracy and prevent trading decisions based on stale or corrupted data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Automated data freshness validation with timestamp warnings for stale data
- [x] Cross-source data comparison between Fed APIs, Yahoo Finance, and backup sources
- [x] Outlier detection algorithms flagging suspicious data points
- [x] API rate limiting monitoring and automatic failover to backup sources
- [x] Data retention policy management for 2+ years of historical data
- [x] Real-time database health monitoring with compression strategy optimization
- [x] Automated alerts for data pipeline failures or degraded performance

## User Journey:

1. Priya receives automated alert at 9:45 AM about Fed API rate limit breach
2. Checks data pipeline dashboard showing automatic failover to Yahoo Finance
3. Reviews data quality metrics and cross-source validation results
4. Analyzes outlier detection alerts for suspicious bond yield spikes
5. Monitors database performance and storage utilization trends
6. Implements data retention policy adjustments for cost optimization
7. Documents pipeline performance and quality metrics for monthly SLA reporting

## Success Metrics:

- 99.9% data pipeline uptime during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- <30 second detection time for data quality issues or API failures
- 99.5% data accuracy validated through cross-source comparison
- Zero trading signals generated from stale data (>30 minutes old)
- <$500/month data storage costs through optimized retention policies

## Technical Requirements:

- Real-time monitoring infrastructure with Prometheus/Grafana or similar
- Automated failover mechanisms between primary and backup data sources
- Data quality validation pipelines with statistical outlier detection
- Database optimization with compression and automated archival processes
- Alert system integration with PagerDuty/Slack for immediate notification
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails for all data pipeline operations

## Pain Points Addressed:

- Manual monitoring consuming 20+ hours weekly for data quality validation
- API failures causing signal blackouts during critical trading periods
- Storage costs escalating due to inefficient data retention policies
- Lack of real-time visibility into data pipeline health and performance
- Delayed detection of data quality issues leading to false trading signals
