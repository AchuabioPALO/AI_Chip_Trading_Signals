## Story: Interactive Signal Performance Validation

**As a** hedge fund analyst,
**I want** to access interactive backtesting capabilities showing historical signal performance,
**so that** I can validate system accuracy and build confidence in current recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Interactive backtesting over 2020-2024 period including COVID stress, 2022 rate hikes, and 2023 AI boom
- [x] Walk-forward analysis to ensure signals aren't overfitted to recent correlations
- [x] Performance metrics: win rate, average returns, maximum drawdown over 30-day holds
- [x] When system shows "NOW" signal, immediate display of similar historical pattern performance
- [x] Backtesting for 5-60 day trading performance validation with 30-90 day data windows
- [x] Statistical significance testing results for signal accuracy
- [x] Real-time P&L tracking for active positions

## User Journey:

1. James accesses backtesting module from main dashboard analytics section
2. Selects historical period (2020-2024) and specific market regime filters
3. Runs walk-forward analysis to validate signal performance across time periods
4. Reviews performance metrics including win rates, Sharpe ratios, and drawdowns
5. Analyzes current "NOW" signal against similar historical patterns
6. Validates statistical significance of results using confidence intervals
7. Generates performance report for strategy committee review

## Success Metrics:

- 65%+ win rate for signals with strength >7 validated through backtesting
- 1.5+ Sharpe ratio achieved consistently across different market regimes
- <15% maximum drawdown during worst historical stress periods
- 95% confidence intervals maintained for all performance metrics
- Statistical significance (p-value <0.05) for signal accuracy claims

## Technical Requirements:

- Historical data storage for 5+ years of bond and equity price data
- Pandas/NumPy for vectorized backtesting calculations and analysis
- Statistical libraries (SciPy/Statsmodels) for significance testing
- Interactive visualization tools (Plotly/Bokeh) for performance charts
- Walk-forward analysis framework with rolling optimization windows
- Performance attribution analysis breaking down returns by signal components

## Pain Points Addressed:

- Lack of confidence in black-box trading signals without historical validation
- Manual backtesting consuming weeks of analyst time for strategy validation
- Overfitting concerns when signals perform well only in recent market conditions
- Inability to quickly assess current signal quality against historical patterns
- Missing statistical rigor in signal performance claims and documentation
