## Story: AI Chip Trading Signal Generation

**As a** portfolio manager,
**I want** to receive 5-60 day trading signals for AI semiconductor stocks,
**so that** I can make informed position sizing and timing decisions before market stress impacts tech stocks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Signal generation for NVDA, AMD, and TSM with strength scoring (1-10 scale)
- [x] Color-coded signal indicators: red (NOW), yellow (SOON), green (WATCH)
- [x] Multiple timeframe support: 20D, 40D, 60D signal windows
- [x] Position sizing recommendations adjusted for volatility periods
- [x] Automated signal scoring with time-to-trade flags
- [x] 20-60 day lead time before chip stock crashes
- [x] Risk management integration with position sizing and stop loss recommendations

## User Journey:

1. Sarah reviews morning signal dashboard at 7:00 AM
2. Checks overnight signal strength changes for NVDA, AMD, TSM
3. Reviews position sizing recommendations based on current volatility
4. Analyzes multiple timeframe signals (20D/40D/60D) for conviction
5. Implements position adjustments before market open
6. Monitors intraday signal strength changes via mobile alerts
7. Exits positions based on signal deterioration or profit targets

## Success Metrics:

- 65%+ win rate on signals with strength >7 over 30-day holds
- 1.5+ Sharpe ratio after transaction costs
- 20-60 day lead time accuracy validated through backtesting
- <5% maximum drawdown on individual signal-based positions
- 85%+ user action rate on "NOW" strength signals

## Technical Requirements:

- Cross-asset correlation engine linking bond stress to chip price movements
- Machine learning models for signal strength scoring and calibration
- Multi-timeframe analysis with pandas rolling window calculations
- Real-time signal processing with 30-minute update frequency
- Position sizing algorithms with volatility adjustment mechanisms
- Integration with existing portfolio management systems

## Pain Points Addressed:

- Reactive position management missing optimal entry/exit timing
- Lack of systematic approach to AI chip sector rotation
- Manual correlation analysis between macro stress and tech stocks
- Overexposure to AI chips during market stress periods
- Missing early warning signals for regime changes in tech sector
