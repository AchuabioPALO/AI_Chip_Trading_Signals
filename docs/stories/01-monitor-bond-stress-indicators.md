## Story: Real-Time Bond Market Stress Monitoring

**As a** quantitative trader,
**I want** to monitor real-time bond market stress indicators with rolling z-scores,
**so that** I can identify early warning signals before they impact AI chip stocks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] System tracks 10Y-2Y yield curve spread with 30-minute updates during market hours
- [x] Rolling z-score calculations over 20/60 day windows to normalize for regime changes  
- [x] MOVE index percentile tracking with automated threshold breach detection
- [x] Credit spread momentum monitoring with statistical significance testing
- [x] Real-time correlation monitoring between bond stress and chip prices
- [x] Automated alerts when 60-day correlation drops below 0.3 threshold
- [x] Graceful handling of API failures with last good data timestamp warnings

## User Journey:

1. Marcus opens trading terminal at 8:30 AM before market open
2. Checks overnight bond market stress indicator dashboard
3. Reviews rolling z-score calculations for yield curve and credit spreads
4. Analyzes MOVE index percentile changes from previous session
5. Monitors real-time correlation coefficients during market hours
6. Receives automated alerts for threshold breaches via Slack
7. Uses stress indicators to calibrate AI chip position sizing

## Success Metrics:

- 99.5% data freshness (no more than 30-minute delays)
- 100% uptime during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- <2 second response time for dashboard updates
- 95% accuracy in correlation monitoring alerts
- Zero false positive alerts for API failure warnings

## Technical Requirements:

- Fed APIs for treasury yield data with rate limiting management
- Yahoo Finance integration for backup equity data sourcing
- Pandas for rolling window calculations and z-score normalization
- Real-time data pipeline with 30-minute update frequency
- Automated quality checks: outlier detection, freshness validation
- Backup data sources with automatic failover capabilities

## Pain Points Addressed:

- Manual bond market monitoring consuming 2+ hours daily
- Delayed reaction to yield curve inversions missing optimal entry points
- Lack of systematic correlation tracking between bonds and chip stocks
- API failures causing trading signal blackouts during volatile periods
- Regime bias in bond stress indicators leading to false signals
