# User Story: 10 - Execute Sector Rotation Strategy

## Persona: Michael (Institutional Portfolio Manager, 12+ years)
**Background:** Senior portfolio manager at hedge fund managing $2B+ in long/short equity strategies. Specializes in sector rotation timing and multi-asset correlation analysis for institutional clients.

## Story: Systematic Sector Rotation Based on Bond Stress Signals

**As a** portfolio manager running long/short equity strategies,
**I want** timing signals for when to reduce tech overweights and pivot to defensive sectors,
**so that** I can optimize sector allocation before broader market stress emerges.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Sector rotation timing recommendations based on bond stress thresholds
- [x] Early warning signals 20-60 days before major tech selloffs
- [x] Integration with existing portfolio management for sector weight adjustments
- [x] Defensive sector recommendations when reducing AI chip exposure
- [x] Historical performance validation of sector rotation signals
- [x] Risk-adjusted return optimization across sector allocation changes
- [x] Automated rebalancing triggers based on signal strength changes

## User Journey:

1. Michael reviews morning sector allocation dashboard showing tech overweight at 35%
2. Analyzes bond stress signals indicating increased probability of tech rotation
3. Reviews recommended defensive sector alternatives (utilities, consumer staples)
4. Implements gradual sector rebalancing reducing tech exposure from 35% to 25%
5. Monitors sector rotation performance through real-time attribution analysis
6. Receives alerts for optimal re-entry timing as bond stress normalizes
7. Documents sector rotation decisions for client reporting and performance attribution

## Success Metrics:

- 20-60 day advance warning validated through historical backtesting
- 2.5%+ alpha generation through sector rotation timing over 12-month periods
- <5% tracking error versus benchmark during sector transition periods
- 75%+ accuracy in predicting major tech sector underperformance periods
- 1.8+ information ratio achieved through systematic sector allocation

## Technical Requirements:

- Sector allocation optimization algorithms incorporating bond stress indicators
- Integration with portfolio management systems for automated rebalancing
- Historical sector performance database with regression analysis capabilities
- Risk attribution analysis tools measuring sector rotation impact
- Real-time sector momentum and correlation tracking systems
- Performance measurement and attribution reporting for institutional clients

## Pain Points Addressed:

- Reactive sector allocation missing optimal rotation timing opportunities
- Manual analysis consuming excessive time for sector allocation decisions
- Lack of systematic approach to defensive positioning during market stress
- Missing early warning signals for tech sector vulnerability periods
- Inefficient transaction costs from poorly timed sector rotation strategies
