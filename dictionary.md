## ðŸ“š Financial Terms & Concepts for Everyone

### **Bond Market Fundamentals**

**Bond Market** - A marketplace where investors buy and sell debt securities (bonds). Think of it like lending money to governments or companies in exchange for regular interest payments.

**Bond Yields** - The annual return you get from holding a bond. When bond prices go up, yields go down (and vice versa). It's like a financial seesaw.

**Yield Curve** - A graph showing interest rates for bonds of different time periods (2-year, 10-year, 30-year). A "normal" curve slopes upward (longer-term bonds pay more). When it "inverts" (shorter-term pays more), it often signals economic trouble ahead.

**10Y-2Y Spread** - The difference between 10-year and 2-year Treasury bond yields. When this goes negative (inversion), it historically predicts recessions within 12-18 months.

**Credit Spreads** - The extra interest that risky borrowers (like corporations) must pay compared to safe borrowers (like the US government). Wider spreads = more market fear.

### **Market Stress Indicators**

**MOVE Index** - Known as the "VIX for bonds." It measures expected volatility in the bond market. Higher values = more uncertainty and stress in the bond market.

**Bond Volatility** - How much bond prices fluctuate. High volatility often signals market uncertainty or economic stress.

**Market Stress** - Periods when investors are worried and selling assets rapidly. Like a financial panic where everyone heads for the exits at once.

**Flight to Quality** - When scared investors dump risky assets (stocks) and buy safe ones (Treasury bonds). It's like running to your mom's house during a storm.

### **Trading & Signal Generation**

**Trading Signal** - A recommendation to buy, sell, or hold an investment based on data analysis. Like a traffic light for traders: green = buy, red = sell, yellow = wait.

**Signal Strength** - How confident we are in a trading recommendation, usually rated 1-10. A "10" means "bet the farm," a "1" means "maybe think about it."

**Z-Score** - A statistical measure showing how unusual a current value is compared to historical averages. A z-score of +2 means "this is pretty weird" and +3 means "this almost never happens."

**Rolling Window Analysis** - Looking at data over moving time periods (like 20 days, then 21 days, then 22 days) to spot trends. It's like a moving spotlight on market data.

**Backtesting** - Testing a trading strategy on historical data to see if it would have made money. Like playing a video game with past market data to see if your strategy works.

**Win Rate** - The percentage of trades that make money. A 65% win rate means 65 out of 100 trades are profitable.

**Sharpe Ratio** - Measures how much return you get per unit of risk. Higher is better. It's like "bang for your buck" but for investments.

**Maximum Drawdown** - The biggest loss from peak to trough. If your portfolio went from $100k to $85k, that's a 15% drawdown.

### **AI & Technology**

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - Computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, like pattern recognition in market data.

**Machine Learning** - A subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.

**Correlation Analysis** - Measuring how closely two things move together. Perfect correlation = 1.0 (they always move together), no correlation = 0 (completely independent).

**API (Application Programming Interface)** - A way for different software systems to talk to each other. Like a universal translator for computer programs.

**Real-time Data** - Information that's updated instantly as events happen, like live stock prices during market hours.

### **Risk Management**

**Position Sizing** - Deciding how much money to put into each trade. Never bet the farm on one horse.

**Risk Management** - Strategies to limit potential losses. Like wearing a seatbelt while driving - you hope you don't need it, but you're glad it's there.

**Diversification** - Spreading investments across different assets to reduce risk. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

**Stop Loss** - An order to sell an investment if it falls to a certain price to limit losses. Like an emergency exit strategy.

### **Market Participants & Strategies**

**Quantitative Trader (Quant)** - Someone who uses mathematical models and statistics to make trading decisions instead of gut feelings or hunches.

**Hedge Fund** - An investment fund that uses advanced strategies to try to make money in any market condition. Often employs quants and sophisticated technology.

**Institutional Investor** - Large organizations like pension funds, banks, or insurance companies that invest huge amounts of money.

**Two Sigma** - A famous quantitative hedge fund known for using AI and data science for trading. We're trying to mimic their systematic approach.

### **Semiconductor & AI Chip Stocks**

**Semiconductor** - The computer chips that power everything from phones to AI systems. Like the "brains" of electronic devices.

**AI Chips** - Specialized computer processors designed for artificial intelligence tasks. Companies like NVIDIA make these.

**Semiconductor Cycle** - The boom-and-bust pattern in chip demand and prices. These stocks can be very volatile.

### **Technical Infrastructure**

**FastAPI** - A modern Python framework for building fast web APIs. The "engine" that powers our backend system.

**Next.js** - A popular React framework for building modern web applications. Powers our trading dashboard.

**SQLite** - A lightweight database system for storing our trading data locally.

**Chart.js** - A JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs in web browsers.

**Real-time Dashboard** - A live display showing current market data, signals, and portfolio performance that updates automatically.

### **Time Horizons & Market Timing**

**Intraday** - Within a single trading day. Like minute-by-minute or hour-by-hour movements.

**Short-term Trading** - Holding investments for days to weeks, not months or years.

**Market Regime** - Distinct periods with different market characteristics (bull market, bear market, high volatility, low volatility).

**Signal Decay** - How quickly a trading signal loses its effectiveness over time. Fresh signals are usually more valuable.

### **Performance Metrics**

**P&L (Profit & Loss)** - How much money you've made or lost on your investments.

**Alpha** - Returns above what the market gives you. If the market goes up 10% and you make 15%, your alpha is 5%.

**Beta** - How much your investment moves compared to the overall market. Beta of 1.0 = moves with market, 2.0 = twice as volatile.

**Benchmark** - A standard to compare your performance against, like the S&P 500 index.

### **Market Psychology**

**Bull Market** - When prices are rising and investors are optimistic. Everyone's making money and feeling good.

**Bear Market** - When prices are falling and investors are pessimistic. The financial equivalent of a rainy day.

**Market Sentiment** - The overall emotional mood of investors. Are they greedy (bullish) or fearful (bearish)?

**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)** - When investors rush into investments because everyone else is making money. Often leads to buying at the top.

### **Data & Analysis**

**Time Series Analysis** - Studying data points collected over time to identify trends and patterns.

**Statistical Significance** - How confident we can be that our results aren't just due to random chance. Usually measured as p-values.

**Confidence Interval** - A range of values that likely contains the true answer. "We're 95% confident the win rate is between 60-70%."

**Anomaly Detection** - Using AI to spot unusual patterns that might indicate trading opportunities or market stress.
